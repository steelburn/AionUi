# Morph

Generate visually compelling PPTs with smooth Morph animations.

**Philosophy**: Trust yourself to learn through practice. This skill provides workflow and references — you bring creativity and judgment.

---

## Use when

- User wants to generate a `.pptx`

---

## What is Morph?

PowerPoint's Morph transition creates smooth animations by matching shapes with **identical names** across adjacent slides.

```
Slide 1: shape name="!!circle" x=5cm  width=8cm
Slide 2: shape name="!!circle" x=20cm width=12cm
         ↓
Result: Circle smoothly moves and grows
```

**Three core concepts:**

- **Scene Actors**: Persistent shapes with `!!` prefix that evolve across slides
- **Ghosting**: Move shapes to `x=36cm` (off-screen) instead of deleting
- **Content**: Text/data added fresh per slide, previous content ghosted first

For details: `reference/pptx-design.md`

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Understand the Topic

Ask only when topic is unclear, otherwise proceed directly.

---

### Phase 2: Plan the Story

**FIRST: Read the thinking framework**

→ Open and read `reference/decision-rules.md` — it provides the structured approach for planning compelling presentations (Pyramid Principle, SCQA, page types).

**Then create `brief.md`** with:

- **Context**: Topic, audience, purpose, narrative structure (SCQA or Problem-Solution)
- **Outline**: Conclusion first + slide-by-slide summary
- **Page briefs**: For each slide:
  - Objective (what should this slide achieve?)
  - Content (specific text/data to include)
  - Page type (title | evidence | transition | conclusion)
  - Design notes (visual emphasis, scene actor behavior)

---

### Phase 3: Design and Generate

**Before generation starts, always remind the user:**

- The PPT file may be rewritten multiple times during build.
- Please do **not** open the target PPT while generation is running, to avoid file lock / write conflicts.
- Use clear, direct language and make this a concrete warning, not an optional suggestion.

**FIRST: Ensure latest officecli version**

Follow the installation check in `reference/officecli-pptx-min.md` section 0 (checks version and upgrades only if needed).

**SECOND: Define topic-driven custom style first (primary path)**

Before selecting any remote style template, define a custom style from the topic itself:

- Palette (primary/accent/background + contrast strategy)
- Typography (title/body scale and hierarchy)
- Mood/tone (e.g. analytical, futuristic, warm, editorial)

This custom style is the primary design source.

Keep this step fast and decisive:

- Produce exactly 1 primary style direction first, not multiple competing directions
- Spend at most one short pass on style definition before moving on
- Do not browse templates at this stage
- Strong-style topics should preserve room for original invention, not force an early template choice

**THEN: Attempt remote OfficeCli fetch before generation (default required path)**

Before generating slides, you MUST first attempt remote fetch unless the user explicitly asks for freeform exploration such as "自由发挥", "free style", "surprise me", or clearly says not to use remote references.

Mandatory pre-generation remote fetch sequence:

1. Attempt to fetch style candidates from OfficeCli `Styles/index.json` (fallbacks allowed per `reference/remote-style-source.md`)
2. Attempt to fetch OfficeCli component rules from `Styles/component/COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md`
3. Record in your working notes whether each fetch succeeded or failed

If both attempts fail, continue immediately with topic-driven custom style + built-in composition rules. Remote failure must not block generation.

Use remote OfficeCli content as a preferred reference source, not as a layout source to copy.

**THEN (conditional): Resolve style template references from OfficeCli remote repository**

Follow `reference/remote-style-source.md` to:

- Discover style template candidates from OfficeCli `Styles/`
- Download only the selected template's `style.md` (and `build.sh` only if needed)
- Store files in a temporary session directory and delete it after generation

Do not pre-download all styles and do not keep persistent local style caches.

Default behavior: always attempt remote index + component fetch first, then proceed with topic-driven custom style + component composition.

Only fetch template references when:

- User explicitly asks for a specific template/style, or
- The design is already structurally planned but needs stronger visual calibration, or
- The agent judges that a remote template will materially improve finish quality after the style and component decisions are already clear.

Skip the remote fetch attempt only when the user explicitly requests freeform generation without reference constraints.

If remote templates are unavailable, continue immediately with topic-driven custom style. Keep all Morph and quality requirements in this skill strictly enforced (`!!`/`#sN-` naming, ghosting, `transition=morph`, per-slide checks, final validation).

**THIRD: Compose pages with component layering workflow**

Use OfficeCli remote component library, defined in `reference/remote-style-source.md`.
Attempt to fetch component docs for every normal PPT task first (default: `Styles/component/COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md`), unless the user explicitly asks for freeform generation.
If remote component fetch fails, continue with the rules below.

Execution model:

- Topic-driven custom style defines palette, typography, tone, and motion mood first
- Component and design-element selection defines structure and visual assembly second
- Remote OfficeCli index and component library are used to calibrate and improve these decisions
- `style.md` is a late-stage visual reference when needed, not a fixed layout template
- Default generation should not depend on template lookup.

Decision order (mandatory):

1. Define the topic-driven custom style
2. Select the page structure and successful components
3. Select supporting design elements/textures/decorations under that style
4. Use OfficeCli remote references to validate or improve the choices quickly
5. Activate a template only if still needed

Speed rules (mandatory):

- Do not spend long comparing many styles or templates
- Check at most 3 remote style candidates before committing
- Prefer the first strong, coherent direction over exhaustive exploration
- Once the page structure and style direction are good enough, start building
- If the agent already has a strong original direction, it may skip template activation even for highly stylized topics

Per-slide selection order (mandatory):

1. Select exactly 1 `L1` main structure
2. Add 1-2 `L0` background textures
3. Add 0-2 `L2` decorations
4. For data-heavy slides, add `L3` content components
5. Add at most 1 `L4` typography effect
6. Use at most 1 Morph primary technique

Hard limits (mandatory):

- Max 1 `L4` per slide
- Max 1 Morph primary technique per slide
- `L0` in text areas should stay subtle (`opacity <= 0.15`)
- `L2` should not dominate text (`opacity <= 0.35` unless tiny and outside text zones)
- If readability is weak: disable `L4` first, then reduce `L2`
- If 2 consecutive slides fail readability/layout checks: downgrade to `L1 + L3 + max 1 L2`
- Use actor naming format: `!!<layer>-<role>-<slot>` for persistent scene actors

Failed-slide definition (for consecutive-failure counting):

- Mark a slide as failed if any of these remains unresolved after one quick adjustment pass:
  - Body text is covered or interfered with by `L2`/`L4`
  - Contrast is insufficient for normal reading
  - Critical overlap/crowding breaks readability
- Consecutive rule:
  - Pass => reset failed counter to 0
  - Failed => increment by 1
  - Counter reaches 2 => switch next slide(s) to downgrade mode (`L1 + L3 + max 1 L2`, no `L4`)

**Rule priority (mandatory):**

1. Hard constraints
2. Readability checks
3. Component/template examples

If examples conflict with rules, rules always win.

**IMPORTANT: Use morph-helpers for reliable workflow**

Generate a bash script that uses `reference/morph-helpers.sh` — this provides helper functions with built-in verification.

**Shape naming rules (for best results)**:

Use these naming patterns for clear code and reliable verification:

1. **Scene actors** (persistent across slides):
   - Format: `'!!actor-name'` (double `!!` prefix, single quotes required)
   - Examples: `'!!ring-1'`, `'!!dot-accent'`, `'!!line-top'`
   - Behavior: Modify position/size/color, NEVER ghost

2. **Content shapes** (unique per slide):
   - Format: `'#sN-description'` (single quotes required)
   - Pattern: `#` + `s` + slide_number + `-` + description
   - Examples: `'#s1-title'`, `'#s2-card1'`, `'#s3-stats'`
   - Behavior: Ghost (x=36cm) when moving to next slide

**Why single quotes?** Shell treats `!` and `#` as special characters. Single quotes prevent this: `'#s1-title'`

**Why this naming matters:**

- ✅ **Better detection**: Primary method (`#sN-` pattern matching) is fastest and most accurate
- ✅ **Readable code**: Anyone can tell `#s1-title` is slide 1's title
- ✅ **Easy debugging**: `grep "#s1-"` finds all slide 1 content quickly
- ⚠️ **Backup detection exists**: Even without `#` prefix, duplicate text detection will catch most issues (but has edge cases)

**Bottom line**: Follow these patterns in your code examples, and verification will work smoothly.

**Then proceed with pattern**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Load helper functions (provides morph_clone_slide, morph_ghost_content, morph_verify_slide)
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/morph-helpers.sh"

OUTPUT="deck.pptx"
officecli create "$OUTPUT"

# ============ SLIDE 1 ============
echo "Building Slide 1..."
officecli add "$OUTPUT" '/' --type slide
officecli set "$OUTPUT" '/slide[1]' --prop background=1A1A2E

# Scene actors (!!-prefixed, will persist and morph across slides)
officecli add "$OUTPUT" '/slide[1]' --type shape --prop 'name=!!ring-1' --prop preset=ellipse --prop fill=E94560 --prop opacity=0.3 --prop x=5cm --prop y=3cm --prop width=8cm --prop height=8cm

# Content shapes (#s1- prefix, will be ghosted on next slide)
# ⚠️ Use generous width (25-30cm for titles) to avoid text wrapping!
officecli add "$OUTPUT" '/slide[1]' --type shape --prop 'name=#s1-title' --prop text="Main Title" --prop font="Arial Black" --prop size=64 --prop bold=true --prop color=FFFFFF --prop x=10cm --prop y=8cm --prop width=28cm --prop height=3cm --prop fill=none

# ============ SLIDE 2 ============

# Use helper: automatically clone + set transition + list shapes + verify
morph_clone_slide "$OUTPUT" 1 2

# Use helper: ghost all content from slide 1 (shape indices 3 = #s1-title)
morph_ghost_content "$OUTPUT" 2 3

# ============ FINAL VERIFICATION ============

echo "✅ Build complete! Open $OUTPUT in PowerPoint to see morph animations."
```

**Key advantages of using helpers:**

- ✅ **Fewer steps**: `morph_clone_slide` = clone + transition + list + verify (4 steps → 1 function)
- ✅ **Instant feedback**: Each helper shows ✅ or ❌ immediately
- ✅ **Can't forget**: Transition and verification are automatic
- ✅ **Clear errors**: If something is wrong, you'll know exactly what and where
- ✅ **Dual detection**: Catches unghosted content by both naming pattern AND duplicate text detection
  - Even if you forget `#` prefix, duplicate detection will still catch the problem!

**Essential rules:**

- **Naming**: Scene actors use `!!` prefix, content uses `#sN-` prefix (best practice for verification and readability)
- **Transition**: Every slide after the first MUST have `transition=morph` (without this, no animation!)
- **Ghosting**: Before adding new slide content, ghost ALL previous content shapes to `x=36cm` (don't delete)
- **Motion**: Adjust scene actor (`!!-*`) positions between slides for animation
- **Variety**: Create spatial variety between adjacent slides
- **Text Width**: Use generous widths to prevent text wrapping:
  - Centered titles (64-72pt): **28-30cm width**
  - Centered subtitles (28-40pt): **25-28cm width**
  - Left-aligned titles: **20-25cm width**
  - Body text: 8-12cm (single-column), 16-18cm (double-column)
  - **When in doubt, make it wider!** See `reference/pptx-design.md` for details

**Design resources:**

- `reference/officecli-pptx-min.md` — Command syntax
- `reference/remote-style-source.md` — OfficeCli remote style + component source (discover + on-demand fetch)

### Phase 4: Deliver

**Outputs** (3 files):

1. `<topic>.pptx`
2. Build script (complete, re-runnable — bash/python/powershell/etc.)
3. `brief.md`

**Verification** (your build script already includes this):

If you used `morph-helpers.sh`, verification is already done! The build script calls `morph_verify_slide` and `morph_final_check` automatically.

Just validate the final structure:

```bash
officecli validate <file>.pptx
officecli view <file>.pptx outline
```

**If verification fails**, see Troubleshooting section below.

**Final delivery message requirements:**

- Tell the user the deck with polished Morph animations is ready.
- Explicitly recommend opening the generated PPT now to preview the motion effects.
- Use affirmative wording (e.g., "ready now", "open it now to preview the animation quality").

### Troubleshooting

**If `morph_verify_slide` or `morph_final_check` reports issues:**

1. **Missing transition**:

   ```bash
   # Check which slides are missing transition
   officecli get <file>.pptx '/slide[2]' --json | grep transition
   officecli get <file>.pptx '/slide[3]' --json | grep transition
   # Expected: "transition": "morph"

   # Fix:
   officecli set <file>.pptx '/slide[2]' --prop transition=morph
   ```

2. **Unghosted content**:

   ```bash
   # Find unghosted shapes manually
   for slide in 2 3 4 5 6; do
       echo "Slide $slide:"
       officecli get <file>.pptx "/slide[$slide]" --depth 1 | grep -E "#s[0-9]"
   done
   # If you see shapes like "#s1-title" on slide 2 (not at x=36cm), they should be ghosted

   # Fix:
   officecli set <file>.pptx '/slide[N]/shape[X]' --prop x=36cm
   ```

3. **Visual issues**:
   ```bash
   # Open HTML preview to debug layout
   officecli view <file>.pptx html
   ```

**Note**: Scene actors (`!!`-prefixed) should appear on all slides — that's normal. Only content shapes (`#sN-` prefix) need ghosting.

### Phase 5: Iterate

Ask user for feedback, support quick adjustments.
